"""2D histograms of a selection's events, the third axis summed (flattened): XY, XT and YT (Basic plots v2).

Each shown axis covers the exact shortest range holding the auto-crop share of its events
(``stats.shortest_range``, as the 1D histograms), or the manual bounds set for it. The flattened axis isn't
cut by auto-crop, so every event of the chosen shots counts; manual bounds set for it limit the events summed
(a T window on the XY histogram images one cloud). Bins are automatic per axis (Freedman–Diaconis, at most
``MAX_AUTO_BINS``) or set (at most ``MAX_BINS``). The image shown may be filtered (``image_filters``) and its
colour range compressed (``compress``), as the DLD port's Density images.

Qt-free (``tests/test_headless_imports.py``'s ``PURE``).
