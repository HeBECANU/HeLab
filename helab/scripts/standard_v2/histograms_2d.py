"""XY, XT and YT histograms (Basic plots v2, LR-13): one plot of the chosen shots' events binned in up to three
planes, each plane's third axis summed over the selection (``helab.analysis.histogram2d``), side by side under
one set of settings; each plane is turned on or off under Planes. With the DLD port's Density images' options
(Tony's choice): blur filters under Blur (``helab.analysis.image_filters``: Gaussian in bins or in m and s, box,
median, Poisson denoise, adaptive KDE; each on by itself, run in the order set), counts per bin or a rate per shot, and the colour
range compressed (sqrt, log, power γ) in the colour map only, so the colour bar reads real values. Bins are set
per axis (T, X, Y), so an axis shown in two planes has the same bins in both. In s and m with SI prefixes (Basic
plots' units). Drawn with PyQtGraph (``ImageItem``) by default, or Plotly or Matplotlib; updated in place as Live
adds shots. Under Image, Draw › dots draws each event (up to Max dots, a fixed sample beyond) instead of the bins,
coloured by nothing, the summed axis or the local density (its bin's value in the image, filtered, on the image's colour
scale), on a white or black plot area. A space axis runs across every plane and T runs up XT and YT. In PyQtGraph and Plotly every space
axis shown has the same scale (metres per pixel, ``SpaceScale``), XY's at equal scales, and T is the same in XT and
YT. Matplotlib gives the space axes the same span instead."""
