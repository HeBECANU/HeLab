# AI to-do

This is the ongoing list of work agents may do without asking Tony: docs upkeep, release
preparation, repo hygiene, verification jobs and small fixes already agreed. Any agent may
raise an item. It is one of three living lists shared by every agent:

- [DECISIONS_TODO](DECISIONS_TODO.md): decisions for Tony, `Q` IDs;
- [MANUAL_TODO](MANUAL_TODO.md): checks that need Tony at a screen or the lab, `M` IDs;
- this file: work agents do, `A` IDs.

**IDs** are `<letter><block>.<item>[.<sub>]`. Blocks are listed in [ID_BLOCKS](ID_BLOCKS.md),
and the ID rules are in [DECISIONS_TODO](DECISIONS_TODO.md). Floors and cloud agents propose
`A~1`, `A~2`… in their handoff, and the Coordinator or the Assistant gives them final IDs when
merging.

How to use this list:

- Each item says where it runs (Ground, a floor or CI) and links to its evidence.
- An item that needs a decision first goes to DECISIONS_TODO, and comes back here once Tony has
  answered.
- Features stay in `roadmaps/_readme.md` and bugs in `roadmaps/known-issues.md`; an item here may
  point to them.
- Tick a done item with its commit, and drop ticked items at each release's tidy-up.

The usual rules still apply:

- ask before committing on Ground;
- floors work on their own branches;
- **tests never touch real data**: real-share items only prepare tools and fixtures, and running
  them on the share stays with Tony.

## Carried over from v0.0.6 (block 1)

- **A1.1 Tidy MANUAL_TODO** (Ground, docs only). Tick or merge the items later work replaced:
  the store-v2 / account-independent SMB-key instructions (now Q1.5), and duplicates between the
  v0.0.5a lists and the later ones. Link the smoke pass from each item it covers. Group what's
  left by where it's checked: Mac, lab PC, lab share, real-data physics. Give the older items
  M IDs as they're touched.
- **A1.2 Build the macOS app locally** (Ground). On the release commit, run
  `pyinstaller HeLab.spec --clean -y`, then check:
  - the zip is ~300 MB and holds only `HeLab.app`;
  - launched from outside the checkout, Help › About matches the version, commit and build stamp;
  - helpers run in the packaged app;
  - the SVG triangle and Qt's SVG icon plugin render.

  This is the macOS half of MANUAL_TODO's "native UI and packaged application" and "release
  evidence". The Windows build is checked on the lab PC with the smoke pass.

  Partly done: the smoke pass built the app at `41a6a7d` and its helpers ran
  ([results](sessions/2026-10-28-claude-smoke-mac/results.md)); About showed `0.0.5a1` there,
  before the bump, so the About check on a release commit is left.
- **A1.3 A picture sheet of every plot** (Ground or a floor). Render each Basic plots v1 and DLD
  port plot natively on macOS (not offscreen) in a 560 px dock, from a synthetic dataset in
  Tony's units, into one sheet that Tony can check in one look. It covers how "ms/mm
  everywhere", "titles wrap" and "the ħ glyph" look; behaviour stays in the smoke pass.
- **A1.4 Edge cases with disposable fixtures** (a floor). Under pytest with the real window
  (`HELAB_SHOW_GUI=1` where it helps), check each case and add a test where none exists:
  - a TXY file written halfway, then finished or repaired;
  - tabs switched and closed during shared listings and loads;
  - cancel and retry during I/O, never beside a helper that is still stopping;
  - a source folder removed mid-load.

  Most of these already have offscreen tests, so first list which ones.
- **A1.6 Hover-menu timing tests** (CI watch). Read each release CI run's logs for hover-menu
  reruns (≈200 ms slack). One that reproduces goes to known-issues with its logs.

### After the smoke pass

- **A1.7 Summarise Tony's I/O trace**, if he recorded one. Run
  `.ai/sessions/2026-10-19-claude-smb-io-audit/trace_summary.py <folder> --under <share> --minutes`.
  Expect:
  - no `roots_verify` bursts;
  - about 0 ops/min while idle;
  - one `load: shot time` per raw file of an uncached load, and none on a cached reload.

  Compare it with the 2026-10-19 audit (`compare_traces.py`). This covers MANUAL_TODO's trace
  items (Live, the DLD port's D7).
- **A1.8 Carry the results into the docs.**
  - Tick the MANUAL_TODO items the [smoke pass](MANUAL_TODO.md#release-smoke-pass) covered.
  - Move the problems it found to known-issues.
  - Move Tony's decisions into the roadmap and `.ai/memory/results/`.

  Partly done: the problems are in known-issues. Left: ticking or marking Mac-passed the
  MANUAL_TODO items the pass overlaps (Presets, Work Offline, Saved results).

## From the audit (block 2)

Finding numbers (#N) refer to the [audit](sessions/2026-10-28-claude-v0.0.6-checks/audit.md).

- **A2.1 Docs refresh** (Ground, docs only, one commit). Bring the docs up to date with what has
  landed, and in line with Tony's decisions where they contradict them:
  - the roadmap and plans' status lines (#8);
  - documents that contradict his decisions (#9, #10);
  - stale memory (#11), known-issues (#12), MANUAL_TODO (#13) and the README (#14);
  - handoff follow-ups that were never carried over, into known-issues, `refactoring.md` and the
    DLD plan (#16);
  - the Maestri note's decisions into `_readme.md`, and the "v0.0.6 changes" note (#7).
- **A2.2 Small app fixes** (a Quick Fixes floor, now that v0.0.6a1 is out):
  - set werkzeug's logger to WARNING (#20);
  - write the watchdog's stall stacks into the log (#19);
  - name the cause in "Disk cache unavailable" (#21);
  - retire the old `diskcache.*` settings keys (#22);
  - lower the back button's log line to DEBUG (#22).
- **A2.3 Idle CPU** (with A2.2): find what repaints at ~35 % CPU in an idle window (#18).
- **A2.4 Unclosed SQLite connections in tests** (with A2.2): run with `-W error::ResourceWarning`
  and tracemalloc to find what opens them (#23). They may explain the Windows file-lock
  failures.

## From the planning-docs audit (block 7)

Finding numbers refer to the [planning-docs audit](sessions/2026-10-28-claude-docs-audit/planning.md).

- **A7.1 Check Dependabot's graph run** (CI watch, from Q6.4). Once v0.0.7 is on `main`, check
  that Dependabot's dependency-graph run passes (no "not our ref" on the submodules) and that
  `dependency-graph.yml`'s snapshot of `requirements.lock` shows in the graph (#7).
- **A7.2 Refresh the lock with `--upgrade`** (a floor or Ground, its own CI run; Q1.9 item 6,
  #8). It brings python-dateutil 3.0 (the lock pins 2.9.0.post0); follow the README's
  "Updating dependencies", then the full suite and the three type checks.

## From the docs and Maestri audit (block 8)

- **A8.1 Call `folder_cache.store_options()` in `HelabMainWindow`** (architecture audit #6).
  `helab/views/HelabMainWindow.py` imports `store_options` by value and
  `tests/test_helabMainWindow.py` patches only `helab.utils.folder_cache.store_options`; once it
  is called as `folder_cache.store_options()`, drop the exception from `io-and-browsing.md`.

## Converter stage 2 (block 11)

From the backend floors' and the bench's handoffs (`sessions/2026-10-29-claude-txy-*/handoff.md`).

- **A11.3 A conftest-wide numba cache fixture**: a session-scoped autouse fixture calling
  `numba_backend.set_cache_folder(<session temp>/numba-cache)`, replacing the numba tests' own (which
  would raise if another file's in-process numba test loaded the kernels first on a worker).
- **A11.4 Faster text I/O** (optional, after stage 4): reading (~560 MB/s) and writing (~340 MB/s)
  are 80-83 % of a compiled conversion and hold the GIL. The rust floor's `parse_strict` (1,910 MB/s)
  and `format_txy` (596 MB/s) are byte-identical on all samples (report only today); wired in behind
  the same checks they'd take rust to ~300 MB/s per core and let threads scale. A vectorised exact
  `%.8g` in NumPy was ~1.5x slower per value than `%` (not worth it while conversions run in processes).

## Converter stage 4, HeLab core (block 12)

- **A12.1 Workers in a frozen app** (`agent/txy-packaging`): run a `convert` with `workers` 2 (spawned
  through `freeze_support`) in the built app on all three OSes; if it works, make `DEFAULT_WORKERS`
  the same as from source (1 frozen today).
- **A12.2 `HeLab.exe convert` on Windows** (`agent/txy-packaging`): the windowed exe has no console;
  check where its output goes, and consider a console launcher (`HeLab-convert.exe`) if the
  acquisition PC needs one.

## Quick Fixes 4 (block 13)

- **A13.1 Helpers start with an explicit working folder** (or, under `SOURCE_GUARD`, the working
  folder leaves the guard's denied list), so a test that `chdir`s can't make a helper's source access
  fail (known-issues, Tests and CI). From Quick Fixes 4's A~2 and Plover's review.

## Converter stage 4, UI and Live (blocks 14, 15)

- **A14.1 An end-to-end GUI test of a plot switching TXY sources** on a folder with real helpers
  (convert, load, Live): the plot's TXY row is checked by unit tests and offscreen rendering only.
- **A14.2 A pending Reload's flag on a source change** (Egret, round 3): `instance.py`'s
  `_reload_from_source` isn't cleared when `set_txy_source` changes the source while a Reload's load
  is pending, so the released picture can stay "loading its TXY source…" until the next run. Reset
  the flag (and the released state) in `set_txy_source`.
- **A15.1 Pace conversions on large shares**: each conversion lists the folder and stats its raw
  files every `live_interval` while auto-convert is on; if M15.1 shows it costs, convert only after a
  Live listing found new names.
- **A15.2 `PresetFolder` and empty folders**: check whether `PresetFolder.check` starts Live twice on
  a folder with no shots yet, as `LaunchFolder` did; same fix if so.
- **A15.3 `test_live.run_helper` sends every field `io_helper` does** (`txy`, `memory_origins`,
  `helab_since`, `listed_mtime`, `seen_names`, `identity_root`), so Live tests elsewhere exercise
  what the helper runs (`test_live_convert.py` already does).

## Quick Fixes 6 (block 20)

- **A20.1 Correct the slow-first hook's comment** (`tests/conftest.py` ~205-209, and the floor's notes):
  workers never see the command line's `--dist` (xdist sets `dist = 'no'` on every worker), so the
  `spread` check is always true under xdist; drop it and fix the comment. Harmless today (Tern).

## TXY ship (block 21)

- **A21.1 Two stale backend strings** (not the ship floor's paths): `helab/convert/backends/numba_backend.py`'s
  docstring says the helper passes a cache folder under `cache_dir()` (now the temp folder, Q18.1);
  `helab/convert/backends/rust.py` (~:7, :80) says "build it with `maturin develop --release`", now
  `python native/build.py --only rust`.
- **A21.2 Developer venvs keep the unshipped packages**: `uv pip install -r requirements.lock` never
  removes numba, llvmlite, mlx, mlx-metal or maturin from Ground's or floors' venvs (harmless: builds
  exclude them, tests run where installed); `uv pip sync requirements.lock` then `uv pip install -e .`
  gives the shipped set. Say so in the README's "updating dependencies" if worth it.

## Store-v4 planning (block 22)

- **A22.1 Shot axes when numbers skip** (Q22.5): the TDC may skip shot numbers on pause/resume.
  Shot trends already plots against shot number or shot time (`shot_trends.py` `X_AXIS`); add a
  "shot index" (consecutive, gaps removed) and offer the same three axes in every per-shot plot.

## Converter follow-ups (block 23)

- **A23.1 Count HeLab's TXY of the tab's tag in folder status** (also A18.1). Waits for Q14.4.
- **A23.2 Colour only the no-hit part of the Live line** if `ElidedLabel` learns rich text (Q23.5).
- **A23.3 Remove the `live_launch_folders` row and its migration** a release or two after v0.0.7.

## Docs audit 2 (block 24)

- **A24.1 Enforce `helab/convert/` as Qt-free** (architecture audit 2, #6): extend
  `tests/test_headless_imports.py` to walk `helab.convert` (`pkgutil.walk_packages`) with
  `backends.numba_kernels` as optional only, so a converter module that imports Qt or
  `helab.utils.constants` fails CI; then `converter.md` and AGENTS.md can say it is enforced.

## Converted-TXY index (block 30)

From the TXY Index floor's [handoff](sessions/2026-10-29-claude-txy-index/handoff.md) (landed `460360b`).

- **A30.1 `events.ShotKeptEvent`'s docstring** still says "no local provenance record": reword to "a
  beside TXY that isn't current (older than its raw file) or written by another conversion meanwhile".
- **A30.2 `helab_txy.converted_usage` at scale**: it still lists each hash folder (names only; `stat`
  only for files the index doesn't know). If `converted-txy/` grows to tens of thousands of TXY,
  measure by the index alone and list folders only on Clear.
- **A30.3 One index connection per `helab convert` run** (not urgent; no starvation seen outside the
  test): `--watch` reopens the index each pass and the app's helper once per request. Keeping
  `helab convert`'s connection for its whole run (reopening after `IndexUnavailable` or a set-aside)
  stops the `-wal` being rebuilt between them; it doesn't make SQLite's lock fair. Cost (Tern): on
  Windows a long-held connection blocks the app helper's set-aside of a damaged index, so the app's
  conversions fail until `helab convert` reopens.
- **A30.5 Settings refuses a temp folder on a network drive or in a synced folder** (Q30.5): the
  cache folder's check (`cache_location.cache_location_problem`) and wording for Settings › General's
  temp folder; an existing such setting kept but warned about once.

## Byte units floor (block 32)

- **A32.1 `result_cache.LARGE_RESULT_BYTES` by OS** (optional): the 50 MB threshold could follow the
  disk unit like the log thresholds, if Tony wants every threshold by OS
  ([handoff](sessions/2026-10-29-claude-byte-units/handoff.md)).

## Smoke ready (block 34)

From the Smoke ready floor's [handoff](sessions/2026-10-30-claude-smoke-ready/handoff.md) (landed `4ad8ac5`).

- **A34.1 Screenshots of QtWebEngine panes on the lab PCs** paint black on screen and so in the grab
  ([memory](memory/results/lab-pc-qtwebengine-black-render.md)); the plot's HTML export covers them.
  No workaround built; the 3D scatter's OpenGL fallback view wasn't grabbed (M34.2).
- **A34.2 A test guard for Qt-made senders**: fail on `X.<signal>.connect(lambda …)` whose lambda
  refers to `X` where `X` comes from `findChildren`/`findChild`/`tabBar()`/`widgetForAction` (Wren's
  AST scan finds 14 such connections, all safe today). It backs AGENTS.md's rule; a sender reached
  through another name would escape it.

## Runner tools (block 35)

From the Runner Tools floor's [handoff](sessions/2026-10-30-claude-runner-tools/handoff.md) (landed `0316bae`).

- **A35.1 A `dev/` wait helper for runners** (`wait_milestone.py EVENT [key=value …] --log <file>
  --timeout S`, built on `app_log.parse_milestone`), if the runbook's waits want more than `grep`.
- **A35.2 `--geometry` through the dev stub**: `open …/HeLab-dev.app --args --geometry …` (Smoke ready
  has landed it); check once.

## UI polish (block 36)

From the UI polish floor's [handoff](sessions/2026-10-30-claude-ui-polish/handoff.md) and Ibis's
[review](sessions/2026-10-30-claude-ui-polish/review.md) (landed `c104502`). Its A~1, the Plotly SIGSEGV fix,
was done on the floor.

- **A36.1** `read_settle_seconds` could move from `SettingsDialog.py` to `constants.py`, beside
  `read_live_interval`.
- **A36.2** `events.ShotUnconvertibleEvent`'s docstring could name the path-too-long message among the
  "failed" reasons.
- **A36.3** (Ibis R3-1) `helab/analysis/panes.py` `update_figure` after `release_figure()` could put a
  released figure back on the Dash server; nothing calls it so today. A guard (ignore, or log) would close it.
- **A36.4** (Ibis R3-2) `tests/test_main_split.py` would accept a settings panel collapsed to zero width;
  check `0 < right` too.

## Quick Fixes 7 (block 38)

From Quick Fixes 7's [handoff](sessions/2026-10-31-claude-quick-fixes-7/handoff.md) (Rivet on Ground, Codex's
review of PR #10, six rounds).

- **A38.1** Audit `helab/io_ops/live.py`'s matching paths for the two gaps Codex found in `save_held`: no
  test for a held HeLab shot whose TXY has gone, nor for a shadowed MATLAB TXY that has settled. Its
  `file_names`/signature shapes are the same, so the same two holes may be there.
- **A38.2** (display only) `AutoConvert.damaged` in `helab/views/explorer_live.py` keeps a file counted
  "damaged" while it stays unconvertible, even when a later profile fails it for another reason; on a new
  summary it could keep only names whose current message starts with `DAMAGED_TEXT`.

## Plot identity (block 41)

From the Plot Identity floor's [handoff](sessions/2026-10-31-claude-plot-identity/handoff.md) (Prism; landed
`e3f94d9`).

- **A41.1 An outdated saved result has no view**: `AnalysisInstance._cached_found` shows it without one.
  If Release or the TXY row ever needs that result's own data, build a hollow view from the saved record
  (coverage and origins). Not needed now: open until Release or the TXY row needs it (Quick Fixes 9
  found no defect, 2026-11-02).

## Quick Fixes 9 (block 46)

- **A46.2 A runtime check for a nameless `QApplication`** (Quick Fixes 9's A~6, optional; after the Plotly worker
  deaths, `b0eb914`): a conftest check that fails a test whose worker's `QApplication` was made with an empty
  argument list (`QCoreApplication.arguments()` empty at the first `qapp`), for code `tests/test_qt_application.py`'s
  AST guard can't see. The guard covers the code today.

## Converter UX (block 48)

From the Converter UX floor's [handoff](sessions/2026-11-02-claude-converter-ux/handoff.md) (Ember; Strata's
[review](sessions/2026-11-02-claude-converter-ux/review.md); landed `ed7bcf9`). A37.1, A39.5 and Q38.1's build
are done.

- **A48.1 Live's test loads without `txy`**: `tests/test_live.py`'s `run_helper` passes a load no `txy` (nor
  `memory_origins`), so its loads never find HeLab's TXY. Give it the fields `io_helper` passes (as
  `test_live_convert.check` does for Live checks) and drop `test_explorer_convert.load_as_the_helper_does`.
- **A48.2 The converter's questions in the accessible-names walk**: add `convert_offer`, `live_share`,
  `beside_refused` and `share_beside_confirm` to `test_accessible_names.ASKS` or `INLINE_SKIPPED` (their IDs
  are checked in `test_explorer_convert.py` only).
- **A48.3 Keep a read stopped early**: the stop is kept only in Live's session and the logs. Record it in the
  provenance row (a column within schema 1), so Folder details can name it for a folder loaded later; the
  same row could tell `ExplorerConverter.offered` that HeLab's TXY already exist in the cache or temp folder
  for a folder not loaded (Strata's info note).
- **A48.4 The output setting's tooltip**: Settings › TXY converter's output tooltip (`ConverterTab.py`) could
  say that a folder on a share asks before writing beside.

## Live Scripts (block 49)

From the Live Scripts floor's [handoff](sessions/2026-11-02-claude-live-scripts/handoff.md) (Lumen; design
[note](sessions/2026-11-02-claude-live-scripts/design.md); Prismo's [review](sessions/2026-11-02-claude-live-scripts/review.md);
landed `971f4af`). A47.5 is done.

- **A49.1 A TXY choice in the Presets row's changes**: the row's dots and "Save N changes" don't count a TXY
  choice changed from the applied preset.
- **A49.2 Same-named helpers in two script folders** share the first one imported (Python's one module
  namespace): detect it and name it in the Scripts panel's error list.
- **A49.3 The presets inspector and TXY profiles**: `PresetsInspector` calls `check_plot` without `profiles`,
  so it doesn't name a preset's unknown TXY profile; pass `{name: file_tag(p)}` from
  `txy_source.known_profiles()`.
- **A49.4 The reopen setting's description**: `reopen_plots_at_start`'s row could name the TXY rule ("a plot
  with its own TXY choice loads it only once HeLab read its folder this session").
- **A49.5 The loading marker's two loose ends** (Prismo's optional notes, re-check 2): test `deliberate=False`
  end to end through `_check_changes` (today only by calling `reload_scripts(…, deliberate=False)`), and reset
  `_pending_deliberate` in `_stop_waiting` when nothing is pending, so a removed folder's waiting deliberate
  reload doesn't make the next auto-reload clear a marker. Both harmless today.

## Live Scripts' follow-ups (block 52)

From the follow-up sessions on the Live Scripts floor (Lumen; Prismo's reviews): the reload-wait race (the Live
Scripts [handoff](sessions/2026-11-02-claude-live-scripts/handoff.md), landed `f534ede`), the
[plot crash](sessions/2026-11-03-claude-plot-library-crash/handoff.md) (landed `823589a`) and the
[preset hang](sessions/2026-11-03-claude-preset-modal-hang/handoff.md) (landed `566eed6`). All test-side.

- **A52.1 Test-made Scripts panels get a Qt parent** (the plot crash's A~2, Prismo's
  [assessment](sessions/2026-11-03-claude-plot-library-crash/review-crash.md)): about 45 test sites make
  `TreePanelWidget(...)` without one (17 in `test_analysis_gui`, 16 in `test_live_scripts`, 4 in
  `test_constant_layers`, the rest in 6 files); give them `TreePanelWidget(window.plots, window)`, the `plot()`
  helpers that drop the panel first. None crashes under forced collections today ([testing](architecture/testing.md)'s
  rule).
- **A52.2 The plot crash's two optional notes** (Prismo's N1, N2): say in the guard test's docstring and at
  `workspace.py`'s two `setParent(None)` sites that the replaced widget is Python's until the `deleteLater()`
  right after hands it back to Qt, and optionally guard `replace_plot_content` too (the RAM budget's release
  picture); make `test_a_dropped_scripts_panel_survives_a_collection_in_its_first_polish` assert its inner run's
  "3 passed", not only exit 0.
- **A52.3 A shared "wait for owed writes, then restart" test helper** (the preset hang's A~1, Prismo's N3):
  other tests that simulate a restart (shut the helpers down) should wait for owed preset writes as
  `test_presets_plots.stored()` now does. Its private reads (`_presets_again`, `_probe_owner`) could later become a
  public `FolderCache.presets_idle()` (an app change).
- **A52.4 Guard the presets' other modals** (the preset hang's A~2): `presets.ask_name` (`QInputDialog`),
  `presets.replace_or_add` and `presets.confirm` (`QMessageBox`, `exec`) open real dialogs unless a test stubs them
  (per instance today, `presets_for`). Make them fail in conftest as `warning_box` does, after checking every test
  that reaches them stubs them; or, broader, a conftest guard on `QMessageBox.exec` / `QDialog.exec` that fails
  unless a test allows it.

## TXY priority lists (block 55)

From the TXY Priority floor's [handoff](sessions/2026-11-03-claude-txy-priority/handoff.md) (design
[note](sessions/2026-11-03-claude-txy-priority/design.md); [review](sessions/2026-11-03-claude-txy-priority/review.md),
TP-1–TP-11 fixed on the floor; landed `9bf99ff`).

- **A55.1 A widget test of Live's offer**: the Live line's "not read here: convert with m23v1?" and the menu's
  "Convert with m23v1 (this folder reads m23v1 only)" have only FolderCache-level tests
  (`test_a_one_entry_folder_offers_its_profile_to_auto_convert`); add one in `test_live_convert.py`'s style.
- **A55.2 Retire the old composition**: `txy_sources.choose`, `helab_txy.compose` and `could_take` are kept for
  their tests and for MATLAB only (`compose(source, matlab, {})`); they can go once their tests move to
  `compose_list`.
- **A55.3 Time the any-HeLab stage**: the fallback's last stage reads provenance records of every tag in HeLab's
  folders for the shots no earlier stage has, so a large folder converted with several profiles reads more rows
  than before. Time it on a lab folder with M55.4.
- **A55.4 A manual convert beside Live's**: Convert this folder… is disabled while Live's Auto-convert converts
  that folder (TP-5). A manual convert with another profile could queue after Live's conversion instead; that
  needs FolderCache's convert jobs keyed by profile.

## Documentation follow-ups (block 56)

From the Docs floor's [handoff](sessions/2026-11-03-claude-docs-manual/handoff.md) (reviews D-1–D-3 and DM-1–DM-4
fixed on the floor; landed `b0e3aac`). Each runs on a floor or Ground; the manual's pages are public text, naming no
person, lab machine or internal ID.

- **A56.2 `dataset_view.py`'s module docstring, public-safe**: it names Q6.6, plots-1 and plots-3, and
  `root_key`'s docstring names a person and a review finding. Then `docs/reference/api/dataset-view.md` may render
  the module instead of naming its classes one by one.
- **A56.3 `docs/.ai-generated/`**: three old planning files in the public `docs/` folder (MkDocs skips dot-folders,
  so the site doesn't show them). Move them to `.ai/sessions/` or delete them. **Stays** (Tony, 2026-11-04, Quick
  Fixes 10's brief: leave `docs/.ai-generated/` where it is).
- [x] **A56.4 The built-in profiles' notes** (done in `0dc4f90`, the five texts approved by Tony 2026-11-04; the
  profiles list's TXY tags in aligned columns, which he asked for then, in `6722408`; Quick Fixes 10, landed
  `20dd672`) shown in Settings › TXY converter carry internal IDs ("stage 3", "Q6.11"): make them user-facing text.
- **A56.5 Stale docs found while writing the manual** (on hold until Tony has tried v0.0.8; Tony, 2026-11-04): `data-roots.md`, `cache-store.md` and `live.md` were
  corrected in the landing's docs pass; left: the comment above `STORE_V4_SETTING` in
  `helab/utils/settings_defaults.py` still says "off until stage 2", while its row is on from v0.0.8.
- **A56.6 Grow `ruff.toml`'s scope** to the rest of what scripts import (`follow.py`, `backends.py`'s panes,
  `stats.py`), each with an API page.
- [x] **A56.7 `helab --help` starts the GUI** (done in `5a4d863`, Quick Fixes 10, landed `20dd672`): `helab/main.py` handles `--version`, `convert` and `cache` before the
  GUI, but not `--help`/`-h`. Print a short usage (the app, `--version`, `--geometry`, `convert`, `cache`, each
  with `--help`) and exit 0, before anything starts.
- **A56.8 The manual's "Which TXY HeLab reads" section** (now a short note): the ordered TXY list (Settings › TXY
  converter › Edit…, a folder's and a plot's own lists, the fallback shots and how a plot's record names them),
  and the External label.

## Test isolation follow-ups (block 57; [handoff](sessions/2026-11-03-claude-fixed-mount-seam/handoff.md))

- [ ] **A57.1 CachedRuns' verification timer outlives a closed plot.** In 41587336570's leaked plots,
  `CachedRuns._verification_due` reached `AnalysisInstance._cached_status` on a deleted QLabel (a plot closed
  while its save waited for the volume check), and `AnalysisInstance.close` raised `'AnalysisRunner' object has
  no attribute 'results'` after its test's runner was released. Both are logged and HeLab goes on. Fix: stop
  `_verify_timer` and drop the plot's callbacks when it closes (or check `sip.isdeleted`), and let `close` skip a
  runner that is gone; a test for each.
- [ ] **A57.2 Windows tests with `--basetemp` on another drive than TEMP's.** conftest's
  `HELAB_TEST_LOCAL_MOUNT` lists only TEMP's drive, so a `--basetemp=.ai/temp/pytest-<name>` on `D:` has no mount
  in the tests' list. Check whether those tests then run as on CI; if not, let it list several drives.
- [ ] **A57.3 An inherited `HELAB_TEST_FIXED_MOUNT`** (Sieve's FM-4, Info): conftest appends to a value set in
  the shell or by a parent process, so that mount stays trusted for the run. Clear it at import before naming
  the temp folder's mount.

## v0.0.8 follow-ups (block 58)

From the Follow-ups floor's [handoff](sessions/2026-11-03-claude-followups/handoff.md) (Mend; Assay's review FU-1,
FU-2 and FU-4 fixed on the floor, FU-3 decided as Q58.3; landed `72ab47a`). Q48.2, Q48.3, Q49.3 (b), Q56.3 and
Q56.1 (b)'s shim are done.

- **A58.1 Zensical, later** (Q56.1 (b), Tony 2026-11-03). Move the manual from Material for MkDocs to Zensical
  once Zensical's versioning is native or mike's Zensical fork is on PyPI, before Material's end of life
  (2027-05-05). The switch needs:
  1. the version menu: native versioning, or the fork (`git+https://github.com/squidfunk/mike.git`, pinned by
     commit in `requirements-docs.lock`), first proven in a CI dry run; `docs/publish/site_versions.py` only calls
     `mike deploy`, `set-default` and `list`;
  2. `docs/hooks/repo_links.py` doesn't run under Zensical: use its built-in `macros` with `{{ config.repo_url }}`
     in the two pages that use `{repo_url}` (checked: a fork's URL comes out right);
  3. `zensical build` has no `-d`: set `site_dir: !ENV [HELAB_DOCS_SITE_DIR, site]` and the variable in CI; keep
     `mkdocs.yml` (Zensical reads it, and `!ENV` needs YAML);
  4. `ci-build.yml`'s manual step (`mkdocs build --strict -d build/manual`), the Docs job and `docs-site.yml` move
     to `zensical build --strict`;
  5. the vendored search shim: Zensical takes the same `extra.polyfills` entry (checked offline).

  Also: Zensical doesn't warn about pages missing from `nav`. The check is the floor's
  [zensical.md](sessions/2026-11-03-claude-followups/zensical.md).
- [x] **A58.2 Folder details' conversion and a read stopped early** (done in `6b22d8d`, Quick Fixes 10, landed
  `20dd672`; the Convert row's amber is A60.1): `explorer_convert.ExplorerConverter` neither names
  a read stopped early nor notifies; Live's auto-convert does both (Q48.1, Q48.2). Route its `shot_converted`
  through the same stop handling.
- **A58.3 The try-import's cost**: the probe adds about 0.2–1 s per script folder at start and on each reload (two
  at once, `PROBES_AT_ONCE`). If a lab PC's cold frozen start makes it slow, reuse one probe process per round for
  several folders (a protocol change).

## The v0.0.8a1 release (block 59)

From CoCo's check of the v0.0.8a1 release (2026-11-04, Tony in Chat: "ok ya add to todo since i had to manually tag
v0.0.8a1 and v0.0.6a1 just now"). For v0.0.9, before its PR.

- [x] **A59.1 Release notes that link their tags** (done in `ca0bd61`, review fix `be2f0e5`, the previous published
  full release as the compare base, Tony's rule of 2026-11-04, in `9e06bcb`; Quick Fixes 10, landed `20dd672`)
  (`dev-cicd.yml`'s release job, `helab/release_draft.py`). CI's
  draft (`v0.0.8a1`, run 41746737106) had a fixed template. Tony had to link the tags by hand. Make the draft's notes:
  1. name and link their tag;
  2. compare against the previous release tag, a "Full Changelog: <previous>...<tag>" link. The previous tag is the
     newest earlier `v*` tag in the commit's history: v0.0.7a1 has none, its release job having failed (run
     41110274554). Pass it as GitHub's `previous_tag_name`;
  3. add GitHub's generated notes (`generate_release_notes`, or `POST /releases/generate-notes` once and merged
     into the body with the manifest marker kept);
  4. fix "Workflow Run": `github.event.repository.url` is the API URL (`api.github.com/repos/…`). Use
     `${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}`.

  Keep the recovery path (`release_draft` resuming an existing draft) and its tests working. Draft bodies are
  rewritten only while they are drafts, never after publishing.
- [x] **A59.2 GitHub's pre-release flag vs the manual's "stable".** (done (b) in `bfa2b78`, the rule in
  `release-and-ci.md`; Quick Fixes 10, landed `20dd672`) CI made the v0.0.8a1 draft a pre-release
  (`RELEASE_PRERELEASE: true`). Tony published it as a full release on purpose, so GitHub's "Latest" is v0.0.8a1;
  as a pre-release, "Latest" would fall back to v0.0.3b. The manual's site goes by the version number
  (`site_versions.py`, PEP 440), so its front page still says "No stable release yet". Asked in Chat (2026-11-04):
  (a) tick "Set as a pre-release" again; (b) keep the release and reword the no-stable front page; (c) the site
  follows GitHub's flag. **Tony chose (b)** (2026-11-04: "b"). To do:
  1. keep v0.0.8a1 a full release (GitHub's "Latest"); the site still goes by the version number;
  2. reword the no-stable front page (`docs/publish/no-stable.html`, the template `site_versions.py` sets as the
     default) to name the newest pre-release as the latest download, e.g. "Latest: 0.0.8a1 (alpha)", linking to
     `pre-release/`;
  3. record the rule in `release-and-ci.md`'s publishing step (a pre-release version may be published as a full
     GitHub release; the site's `latest` stays the newest stable version, and until there is one the front page
     names the newest pre-release).

## Quick Fixes 10 (block 60)

From Quick Fixes 10's [handoff](sessions/2026-11-04-claude-quick-fixes-10/handoff.md) (Rivet; A59.1, A59.2 (b),
A56.7, A58.2 and A56.4 done; landed `20dd672`, CI 41770471113).

- [ ] **A60.1 Folder details' Convert row amber for a read stopped early** (Quick Fixes 10's A~1;
  `helab/views/FolderDetailsPanel.py`). Live's Auto-convert row turns amber when it names a read stopped early
  (`READ_STOPPED`); the Convert ("offer") row, which names them since A58.2 (`6b22d8d`), doesn't. A two-line change
  beside the `convert` row's style, with a test.
- [ ] **A60.2 Pin `packaging` in the release jobs** (Quick Fixes 10's A~2; `.github/workflows/dev-cicd.yml`).
  get-version and, since A59.1, the release job run `pip install packaging` unpinned; `requirements.lock` has
  `packaging==26.3`. Pin it to the lock's version (or install it from the lock), keeping `--check`'s builds as they
  are.

## Not AI work (stays in MANUAL_TODO)

These need a real share, lab hardware or a person in the lab:
- remounts, and two mounts of one folder;
- read-only shares, and mapped-drive spellings on Windows;
- the converter and the lab's MATLAB scripts ignoring `.helab-root`;
- the physics checks on real data: temperatures, condensate fits, g², release time, the QE
  calibration;
- release recovery in a disposable release;
- the self-update questions for ANU IT.
