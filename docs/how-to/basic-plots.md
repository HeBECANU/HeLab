# Plot a folder with Basic Plots

**Basic Plots** are HeLab's own quick-look plots of a folder's events. They're in the Scripts panel on the
right: choose **Basic Plots** in its group menu. The tree lists each version as a node, newest first:

- **v2**, the current set, open in the tree;
- **v1**, the first set, kept exactly as it was, so the results, presets and plot arrangements saved with it
  still open.

Each version keeps its own presets: a preset saved for a v1 plot isn't offered to its v2 plot.

## Open a plot

1. Load a folder's data in a tab.
2. Click **Plot** beside a script, for example "Counts per shot".

The plot opens in the middle, on the data the tab shows; its settings show in the panel above the Scripts
panel. While a plot of a script is open, its button reads **New**, and its tooltip says how many are open,
for example "Open another Counts per shot plot (1 open)". **New** opens another plot of the same script,
with its own settings, so that you can compare settings side by side.

## The v2 plots

| Plot | What it shows |
|---|---|
| 3D scatter | The events in T, X and Y, cropped to the region holding most of them |
| Counts per shot | The events in each shot, against its shot ID or its time |
| T, X, Y histograms | The distributions of T, X and Y |
| XY, XT, YT histograms | The events binned in the XY, XT and YT planes side by side, each plane's third axis summed |
| Transfer fractions | Each shot's share of atoms in each diffraction order, against its shot ID or its time |

Every Basic plot can be drawn with PyQtGraph (the default for 2D plots), Plotly (the default for the 3D
scatter, with **Open in browser**) or Matplotlib: **Drawing › Library** in its settings. Switching library
redraws the plot without running it again. Times are in seconds and lengths in metres, with SI prefixes
(ms, mm, µm).

## Shot ID or shot time

**Counts per shot** and **Transfer fractions** have an **X axis** setting:

- **Shot ID** (the default): the shot number of each `d<N>.txt`.
- **Shot time**: when each shot was taken, on your computer's clock. The axis shows the time of day and,
  zoomed out, the date.

A shot's time is its raw `d<N>.txt` file's modification time. A shot without a raw file takes its TXY file's
time instead, which is when it was converted, so several shots converted together share one time. Those shots
are drawn as **amber triangles**, and the plot's title counts them (`⚠ 3 TXY times (no raw file)`). A shot
with no time at all is left out of a Shot time axis, and the title counts it too. A copied or rewritten file
has a new modification time.

Between runs, or after a stall, the line breaks instead of joining the gap: it stops where the time to the
next shot is over ten times the shots' usual interval.

While Live is on, new shots join either axis in place, and a zoom or pan you made stays.

## XY, XT, YT histograms

This plot bins the chosen shots' events in up to three planes, side by side, and sums each plane's third axis
over them: XY sums T, XT and YT sum Y or X. XY has X across and Y up; XT and YT have X or Y across and T up. Every space axis
shown has the same scale, so a cloud is as wide in XT as in XY, and zooming or panning one plane moves the others
with it (X shared by XY and XT, Y by XY and YT, T by XT and YT).
The planes share one set of settings. With counts per bin they share one colour bar, right of the last plane,
over the same range: from 0 to the highest bin of the planes shown. A rate per shot is per mm² in XY but per mm·ms
in XT and YT, so then XY has its own colour bar, left of the planes, and XT and YT share one on the right, each
from 0 to the highest bin of its own planes. (Dots coloured by the summed axis have one bar for it; dots without
colour have none.) The settings:

- **Planes**: turn XY, XT and YT on or off. Only the planes that are on are computed.
- **View range.** With **auto-crop**, each shown axis covers the shortest range holding the share of events
  you keep (99 % by default), and the summed axis isn't cut. With **manual**, the bounds you set cut the
  events: a T range on the XY histogram images one cloud. An axis left unset (min = max), or with its min
  above its max, covers all its events. Turn on **Sum the whole summed axis** to leave the
  summed axis's bounds out, so that they cut only the two shown axes.
- **Draw**: **histogram** (the events in bins) or **dots** (each event as a dot, no bins drawn, over the same
  view range). With dots:
    - **Dot colour**: **none** (one colour; overlaps look darker), **summed axis** (each dot's own third
      coordinate: T on XY, Y on XT, X on YT, over its range in that plane, which the plane's title gives) or
      **local density** (the value of the dot's bin in the image, after any blur, on the colour scale below;
      the densest dots are drawn on top).
    - **Max dots**: at most this many dots in each plane (200,000 by default). Beyond it a fixed random sample
      is drawn, and the plane's title says so. The bins and the local density still count every event.
    - **Background**: white or black behind the dots (the titles, axes and colour bar stay on white). Black
      brings out faint dots; uncoloured dots are then white.
- **T bins**, **X bins** and **Y bins**: each axis's bins wherever it is shown, up to 10,000; 0 picks the
  count from the data (at most 1,000). A plane holds at most 16,000,000 bins (4,000 × 4,000), for memory:
  over that, both its axes' bins are scaled down in proportion, and the plane's title says so.
- **Blur**: six filters, each in its own section with an **On** switch; its settings show once it's on. They
  run one after another, in increasing **Order** (filters with the same number run in the order listed), and
  each plane's title lists the ones that ran:
    - **Median**: each bin becomes the median of the square of bins around it (**Size**), which takes out lone
      hot bins and keeps edges sharp. It's the only one that doesn't keep the total.
    - **Denoise (counts)**: made for counts. It evens out the counting noise (the Anscombe transform), blurs by
      **σ** bins and transforms back. Best first, on the counts themselves.
    - **Adaptive KDE**: an adaptive kernel density estimate. Faint regions are smoothed more and bright cores
      less: each bin's own σ is between ¼ and 4 times **σ**, set by how bright it is (**α**: 0 is a plain
      Gaussian, ½ the usual choice).
    - **Gaussian (σ in bins)**: a Gaussian blur, **σ** in bins.
    - **Gaussian (σ in m, s)**: a Gaussian blur with **σ on X, Y** in metres and **σ on T** in seconds, so
      it's the same size in every plane whatever their bins.
    - **Box**: the mean over the square of bins around each bin (**Size**).

  The two Gaussians and the box commute: their order among themselves changes nothing. The median, denoise
  and the adaptive KDE don't, so where they sit in the order matters. A σ is at most a quarter of the
  image's side on each axis, and the plot says when it was capped.
- **Show**: counts per bin, or a rate per shot (counts per shot per bin area: events / mm² / shot for XY,
  events / (mm·ms) / shot for XT and YT, whatever units the axes show).
- **Colour scale**: linear, sqrt, log (spanning **Decades** below the maximum) or power γ. Only the colours
  are compressed: the colour bar still reads the real values.

## Plot info

The top of each plot's settings is **Plot info**. Closed, it's one line naming the plot's input, its
revision and whether it follows Live; its tooltip gives the folder's full path. Click **Plot info** to open
it. It then lists:

- the source line;
- the shots used, the analysis and its version, and whether the result came from the disk cache;
- the settings in short;
- the data's TXY;
- the full record: the data root, the signature, the shots covered, and every parameter.

Long folder names wrap, and a long record scrolls.

The line above each plot is kept short: `Data source: <folder> · rev N · following Live`, or
`Showing previously loaded data: …` when the tab now shows other data than the plot ran on. It ends with
**outdated** while a saved result that no longer matches its data or script shows, and with **⚠ N** when the
run has N warnings (for example a manual range with its min above its max). Hover over it for the warnings in
full and the full record; Plot info lists them too.
